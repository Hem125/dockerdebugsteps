If you want to uninstall Docker and then reinstall it to resolve the issue, you can follow these steps:

**Uninstall Docker:**

1. Stop the Docker service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop docker
   ```

2. Uninstall Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo apt remove docker.io
   ```

3. Remove any Docker configuration files that might be left behind:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /etc/docker
   ```

**Install Docker:**

Now, you can proceed with the installation of Docker:

1. Update the package repository to ensure you have the latest information:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install the Docker dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```

3. Add the Docker GPG key to your system:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

4. Add the Docker repository:

   ```bash
   echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   ```

5. Update the package repository again:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

6. Install Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```

7. Start the Docker service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

8. Verify that Docker is running without errors:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status docker
   ```

This should reinstall Docker on your system. After completing these steps, Docker should be up and running, and you can check its status to ensure that it's working as expected:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```
